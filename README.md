**Welcome**

This is my fist plugin
A very Simple plugin to make Makefiles, still in pre-Alpha testing

makes simple make files..

**Keys**

Ctrl+Alt+M while a C++ file is open will run the command on windows, Haven't tested it on Mac or Linux yet...
the command will make a Makefile in the same directory of the C++ file.

For now, make a copy of the CppBuilder.sublime-settings file in your User folder (Accessed through Prefrences > Browse Packages) and make changes to the files and test it out...
